# AI-based-Voice-Assistant

In this project, I aimed to build an AI-based voice assistant using Speech Recognition and ASR Model. The voice assistant is designed to recognize user voice commands and execute the corresponding actions.

Tools and Technologies Used:
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

Python Programming Language
Speech Recognition Library
Google Speech-to-Text API
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
PyAudio Library

After implementing the above steps, we were able to build a fully functional AI-based voice assistant that can accurately recognize and respond to user voice commands. The voice assistant can perform a wide range of tasks, including playing music, setting reminders, answering questions, and more.
